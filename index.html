        <h2>Vicious Cycles</h2>
        A local bike workshop adamant about sharing their love for biking, that sells bikes and accessories, and takes
        custom bike orders.
        Mission statement: Vicious Cycles hopes to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene because
        each and every one of them is a biking enthusiast.

        <h2>Why Vicious Cycles?</h2>
        When it comes to industry-leading innovations in cycles and accessories, Vicious Cycle products are what you
        have been waiting for. We sell top-quality cycling equipment and have been doing it for years. Our products have
        become the supply line of choice and lesser companies have been copying us for some time. Don't be fooled by
        imitators, Vicious Cycles is the real deal. Don't settle for second best when it comes to your cycling needs,
        but don't feel you have to raid your savings. Vicious Cycle Products is a name you can put your trust in, at a
        price you can afford. Of course, custom work is another thing entirely. At Vicious Cycles, we are not interested
        in a "Race to the Bottom" when it comes to creating custom builds. If you're interested in discussing a fully
        custom or customized build, come down to our store and visit with us to find out what we can really do.

        <h2>Brand</h2>
        Vicious Cycles philosophy is that when you choose your bike, you should choose it based on the folks who will
        not only build your bicycle, but also those who will help you get comfortable on the bike, as well as provide
        service down the road as you need it.
        Vicious Cycles wants to achieve this by selling bikes, making custom bikes, motorcycles, concept vehicles, and
        accessories.
